After you clone the GitHub Folder, you need to change the remote origin of your GitHub folder
You can remove the remote origin and add your own remote origin by:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/new-user/new-repo.git
Then you can push your project into your GitHub locally in the repo you just created
